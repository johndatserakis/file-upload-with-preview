## 4.1.0

## 4.0.1, 4.0.2

- Removing unneeded wrapper divs in preview panels
- Adding `token` attribute on each preview panel

## 4.0.0

- Refactor of basically entire library. Many methods changed, properties changed. Please read the README and update your code accordingly. This refactoring was necessary due to the need for additional methods that allow for more control and replacement of the `cachedFileArray`.
- Removed `rollup-plugin-buble` in favor of `rollup-plugin-bable` due to the former not fully supporting `async/await`.

## 3.2.0

- Moves from Gulp to Webpack

## 3.1.0

- Made updates for accessibility.
- Added `text` object to `options` so that the input copy can be changed.
- Updated the README accordingly with these changes.

## 3.0.1

- Removed the option to _not_ show a grid of files when setting `multiple` on the input. The logic messiness wasn't worth it considering we don't really need the option now that we have a grid view for multiple images.
- Cleaned up logic flow.
- _Added_ buttons for deleting indivudual files in the grid view. Also includes the option to disable this feature.
- Added a deletion event that gets triggered when a file is deleted.
- Updated the README accordingly with these changes.

## 3.0.0

- Rewrite of the library code. Made the handling of multiple images a bit more clear. Tried to clean up the logic and set properties only a single time when needed. Should all be a bit more clear now.
- Showing the grid of images in the case of multiple is now the default setting. To stop that, pass
  `{showMultiple: false}` when initializing the class.
- All further options are now set up to be passed in a single `options` object during initialization. This will be good for any further additions.
- Restructured how the `imageSelected` event is done as to make it a bit easier to use - see updated documentation on how to use that event.
- `custom-file-container__image-preview__active` was changed to `custom-file-container__image-preview--active` to be inline with BEM style.
- Added overflow to multiple image pane, so when there's a ton of images it doesn't just keep growing in height.

## 2.1.2 (2018-09-21)

- Merged in #12 from @firstor - support for .gifs in both single and multiple previews.
